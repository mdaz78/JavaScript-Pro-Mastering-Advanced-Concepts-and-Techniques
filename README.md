## JavaScript Pro: Mastering Advanced Concepts and Techniques

This repository contains my practice code while taking the course **JavaScript Pro**. All code examples are organized by course sections for easy navigation.

- **Course**: [JavaScript Pro on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pro-javascript/)
- **Structure**: Each folder (`section1`, `section2`, ...) corresponds to a section from the course.

## Repository Structure

- `section1/`: Intro exercises, array utilities, and basic DOM examples
- `section2/`: Continued exercises and examples for subsequent topics

## How to Run

- Open the `index.html` inside a section (e.g., `section1/index.html`, `section2/index.html`) in your browser, or use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
- JavaScript files are included per section (e.g., `app.js`, utilities, and exercise files).

## Notes

- This repo is primarily for learning and experimentation.
- Filenames and directories mirror the course sections to make it easier to track progress.
